# Concrete5 less starter

  - Responsive mixins
  - Predefined colors for buttons, borders and others
  - Automatically defining fonts, just by naming them.
  - And others

Install the package globally or locally and make sure you have a 'predefined' and inside place: (footer.less, general-style.less, header.less, mixin.less, slider.less)

$ c5-install 'theme-name'
